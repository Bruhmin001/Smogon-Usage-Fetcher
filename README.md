# Smogon-Usage-Fetcher
This project comprises two files: Code_0 and Code_1.

Code_0 retrieves files from the official Smogon website and appends them to the master_sheet.csv file. It automates the fetching process from the Smogon website, ensuring that the data in master_sheet.csv is up to date. You don't need to run this file independently; it's primarily for internal processing and updating the dataset.

Code_1 is the main script where you interact with the data. Upon execution, it prompts the user to enter a Pokémon name. After entering the name, the script generates a CSV file named Usage_stats.csv. This CSV file contains usage statistics for the specified Pokémon, which can be utilized for various data analysis purposes.

By running Code_1 and inputting a Pokémon name, you can easily obtain usage statistics in a structured format, facilitating further analysis and insights into the popularity and trends of different Pokémon in competitive play.
